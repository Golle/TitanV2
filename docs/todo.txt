# Asset Processor
The asset processor is currently just a command line tool that will walk through all assets in a folder and put them into a single binary, based on some configuration in the metadata files.   
The long term goal is to have a hot reload system, that can detect changes and create reloadable files that the engine can consume in debug builds. 

## Hot Reload

### Asset Processor
    [ ] Rework compilation step into multiple steps.
        [ ] Create and validate metadata files.
        [ ] Process assets and create AssetDescriptors
        [ ] Write assets in the format engine can consume to a binary folder
        [ ] For release builds, combine all these into a single file (per registry)

### Engine Runtime
    [ ] Load data from files intead of combined registry when HotReload is enabled(only possible in debug builds)
    [ ] Implement support for "polling" files for changes
    [ ] Reload assets, load a new one and swap with old.
