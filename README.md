### Titan - Version 5623

This is Titan, the C# only game engine.

### A new beginning
Titan has been under research & development for the last 3-4 years. A lot of different concepts have been tested out and discarded.   
This is the new iteration of Titan, a new architecture with focus on making everything run in parallel. The standalone editors have been dropped and will be replaced by simple CLI tools. This is to reduce the scope and reduce the dev time before it can be utilized to build games.

Source Generators will be used to remove most of the boiler plate code needed to create systems. A new chunk based implementation of the ECS will be added (a prototype of this can be found in the Kepler repo)

Looking forward for an exciting 2024.
